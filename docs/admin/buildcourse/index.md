# Building a Course Package

In this section, we describe how to create and edit the material for a course to grade.
Each course in the LLM grader is represented by a **course package** (sometimes called **solution package**) that includes
a configuration file and a set of unit files describing the questions and solutions in each
unit.  

- [Admin access](login.md)
- [HTML notes](htmlnotes.md)
- [Package configuration](pkgconfig.md)
- [Unit XML](unitxml.md)
- [Upload](upload.md)
