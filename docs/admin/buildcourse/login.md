# Admin Login

Before uploading and viewing a course package, you will need to login as an Administrator.
Go to **File->Admin login**.  You will be prompted for a password.
This password should match the value of `LLMGRADER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` when the system 
was [deployed](../deploy/password.md).  

If you do not know the password, you can go to the render and view the environment variables.
If you do not have access to the render deployment, ask someone who does.
